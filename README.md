# guildwebsite

### [Demo](https://noideaguild.netlify.app/)

This is a guild website for World of Warcraft that I built completely from scratch. No libraries or frameworks, just pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Website: This website is for a World of Warcraft raiding guild where players interested in playing in the guild can fill out a quick application through the form.
The form data is received and sent to my personal email address.

The only thing that I didn't code was the lightbox functionality. I found the mini-plugin on GitHub: https://github.com/lokesh/lightbox2
